9.11  2021-03-20
  - This release contains fixes for security issues, everybody should upgrade!
  - Disabled format detection by default to fix vulnerabilities in many Mojolicious applications. That means some of
    your routes that previously matched "/foo" and "/foo.json", will only match "/foo" after upgrading. From now on you
    will have to explicitly declare the formats your routes are allowed to handle.
      # /foo
      # /foo.html
      # /foo.json
      $r->get('/foo')->to('bar#yada');
    becomes
      $r->get('/foo' => [format => ['html', 'json']])->to('bar#yada', format => undef);
    And if you are certain that your application is not vulnerable, you also have the option to re-enable format
    detection for a route and all its nested routes. Due to the high risk of vulnerabilities, this feature is going to
    be removed again in a future release however.

      $active->get('/foo')->to('Test#first');
      $active->put('/bar')->to('Test#second');

    consistently.

7.92  2018-08-09

    Mojolicious applications becoming unstable. While there are no known exploits yet, we've chosen to err on the side
    of cautiousness and will classify this as a security issue.

7.87  2018-07-04
  - Added optional support for Cpanel::JSON::XS to Mojo::JSON for much better JSON encoding and decoding performance.
    That also means Mojo::JSON can no longer encode the two Unicode whitespace characters u2028 and u2029, since this is
    unsupported by Cpanel::JSON::XS.

  - Added request_id attribute to Mojo::Message::Request.
  - Improved all built-in templates to contain a comment with their request id.
  - Improved some log messages to contain a request id.

7.80  2018-05-20
  - Many users expected that Mojo::UserAgent would verify all TLS certificates by default. Unfortunately that has not
    been the case so far, but will change with this release in an effort to strengthen security. By default
    Mojo::UserAgent will now reject all invalid TLS certificates. To return to the previous behavior you can use the new
    insecure attribute.
      $ua->insecure(1);
    To make testing easier, Test::Mojo will default to having the insecure attribute activated. And with the get command
    you can use the new -k option.
      mojo get -k https://127.0.0.1:3000
    That also means that Mojo::IOLoop::TLS will no longer have a default tls_verify value. To disable TLS certificate
    verification there you can use the value 0x00.
      $tls->negotiate(tls_verify => 0x00);
  - Added insecure attribute to Mojo::UserAgent.
  - Added EXPERIMENTAL server method to Mojolicious.
  - Added EXPERIMENTAL before_server_start hook.

7.76  2018-04-23
  - Due to lack of domain experts on the team, Windows is no longer officially supported. Moving forward, we will try to
    keep Mojolicious installable on Windows, but cannot make any promises regarding security and/or reliability.
  - Fixed a bug in Mojolicious::Plugin::Config where the config stash value was not available when the config_override
    feature was used. (tim)

7.75  2018-04-09

  - Improved documentation browser with links to MetaCPAN.

7.49  2017-10-28
  - Deprecated Mojo::IOLoop::Delay::data and Mojo::IOLoop::Delay::remaining.
  - Added Promises/A+ support. Note that Mojo::IOLoop::Delay previously inherited a catch method from Mojo::EventEmitter
    that was passed the error message as second argument instead of the first, so you might have to change
      $delay->catch(sub { my ($delay, $error) = @_; ... });
