Back in the early days of the web there was this wonderful Perl library
called L<CGI>, many people only learned Perl because of it.
It was simple enough to get started without knowing much about the language
and powerful enough to keep you going, learning by doing was much fun.
While most of the techniques used are outdated now, the idea behind it is
not.
L<Mojolicious> is a new attempt at implementing this idea using state of the
art technology.

=head2 Duct Tape For The HTML5 Web

Web development for humans, making hard things possible and everything fun.
