                        The Web Socket protocol
                  draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-68

Abstract

   The Web Socket protocol enables two-way communication between a user
   agent running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to a
   remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code.  The
   security model used for this is the Origin-based security model
   commonly used by Web browsers.  The protocol consists of an initial
   handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The
   goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based
   applications that need two-way communication with servers that does
   not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g. using
   XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).

Internet-Draft           The Web Socket protocol           December 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   _This section is non-normative._

   Historically, creating an instant messenger chat client as a Web
   application has required an abuse of HTTP to poll the server for
   updates while sending upstream notifications as distinct HTTP calls.

   This results in a variety of problems:

   o  The server is forced to use a number of different underlying TCP
      connections for each client: one for sending information to the
      client, and a new one for each incoming message.

   o  The wire protocol has a high overhead, with each client-to-server
      message having an HTTP header.

   o  The client-side script is forced to maintain a mapping from the
      outgoing connections to the incoming connection to track replies.

   A simpler solution would be to use a single TCP connection for
   traffic in both directions.  This is what the Web Socket protocol
   provides.  Combined with the Web Socket API, it provides an
   alternative to HTTP polling for two-way communication from a Web page
   to a remote server.  [WSAPI]

   The same technique can be used for a variety of Web applications:
   games, stock tickers, multiuser applications with simultaneous
   editing, user interfaces exposing server-side services in real time,
   etc.

1.2.  Protocol overview

   _This section is non-normative._

   The protocol has two parts: a handshake, and then the data transfer.

   The handshake from the client looks as follows:

        GET /demo HTTP/1.1
        Upgrade: WebSocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        Host: example.com
        Origin: http://example.com
        WebSocket-Protocol: sample

Internet-Draft           The Web Socket protocol           December 2009


   The handshake from the server looks as follows:

        HTTP/1.1 101 Web Socket Protocol Handshake
        Upgrade: WebSocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        WebSocket-Origin: http://example.com
        WebSocket-Location: ws://example.com/demo
        WebSocket-Protocol: sample

   The first three lines in each case are hard-coded (the exact case and
   order matters); the remainder are an unordered ASCII case-insensitive
   set of fields, one per line, that match the following non-normative
   ABNF: [RFC5234]

     field         = 1*name-char colon [ space ] *any-char cr lf
     colon         = %x003A ; U+003A COLON (:)
     space         = %x0020 ; U+0020 SPACE
     cr            = %x000D ; U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
     lf            = %x000A ; U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
     name-char     = %x0000-0009 / %x000B-000C / %x000E-0039 / %x003B-10FFFF
                     ; a Unicode character other than U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), or U+003A COLON (:)
     any-char      = %x0000-0009 / %x000B-000C / %x000E-10FFFF
                     ; a Unicode character other than U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)

   Lines that don't match the above production cause the connection to
   be aborted.

   NOTE: The character set for the above ABNF is Unicode.  The headers
   themselves are encoded as UTF-8.

   Once the client and server have both sent their handshakes, and if
   the handshake was successful, then the data transfer part starts.
   This is a two-way communication channel where each side can,
   independently from the other, send data at will.

   Data is sent in the form of UTF-8 text.  Each frame of data starts
   with a 0x00 byte and ends with a 0xFF byte, with the UTF-8 text in
   between.

   The Web Socket protocol uses this framing so that specifications that
   use the Web Socket protocol can expose such connections using an
   event-based mechanism instead of requiring users of those
   specifications to implement buffering and piecing together of
   messages manually.

   The protocol is designed to support other frame types in future.
   Instead of the 0x00 byte, other bytes might in future be defined.
   Frames denoted by bytes that do not have the high bit set (0x00 to

   0x7F) are treated as described above (a stream of bytes terminated by
   0xFF).  Frames denoted by bytes that have the high bit set (0x80 to
   0xFF) have a leading length indicator, which is encoded as a series
   of 7-bit bytes stored in octets with the 8th bit being set for all
   but the last byte.  The remainder of the frame is then as much data
   as was specified.

   This wire format for the data transfer part is described by the
   following non-normative ABNF, which is given in two alternative
   forms: the first describing the wire format as allowed by this
   specification, and the second describing how an arbitrary bytestream
   would be parsed.  [RFC5234]

     ; the wire protocol as allowed by this specification
     frames        = *frame
     frame         = text-frame
     text-frame    = (%x00) *( UTF8-char ) %xFF

     ; the wire protocol including error-handling and forward-compatible parsing rules
     frames        = *frame
     frame         = text-frame / binary-frame
     text-frame    = (%x00-%x7F) *( UTF8-char / %x80-%x7E ) %xFF
     binary-frame  = (%x80-%xFF) length < as many bytes as given by the length >
     length        = *(%x80-%xFF) (%x00-%x7F)

   The UTF8-char rule is defined in the UTF-8 specification.  [RFC3629]

   NOTE: The above ABNF is intended for a binary octet environment.


   The following diagrams summarise the protocol:

        Handshake
           |
           V
        Frame type byte <-------------------------------------.
           |      |                                           |
           |      `-- (0x00 to 0x7F) --> Data... --> 0xFF -->-+
           |                                                  |
           `-- (0x80 to 0xFF) --> Length --> Data... ------->-'

1.3.  Design philosophy

   _This section is non-normative._

   The Web Socket protocol is designed on the principle that there
   should be minimal framing (the only framing that exists is to make
   the protocol frame-based instead of stream-based, and to support a



Hickson                   Expires June 19, 2010                 [Page 6]

   distinction between Unicode text and binary frames).  It is expected
   that metadata would be layered on top of Web Socket by the
   application layer, in the same way that metadata is layered on top of
   TCP/IP by the application layer (HTTP).

   Conceptually, Web Socket is really just a layer on top of TCP/IP that
   adds a Web "origin"-based security model for browsers; adds an
   addressing and protocol naming mechanism to support multiple services
   on one port and multiple host names on one IP address; and layers a
   framing mechanism on top of TCP to get back to the IP packet
   mechanism that TCP is built on, but without length limits.  Other
   than that, it adds nothing.  Basically it is intended to be as close
   as possible to just exposing raw TCP/IP to script as possible given
   the constraints of the Web. It's also designed in such a way that its
   servers can share a port with HTTP servers, by having its handshake
   be a valid HTTP Upgrade handshake also.

1.4.  Security model

   _This section is non-normative._

   The Web Socket protocol uses the origin model used by Web browsers to
   restrict which Web pages can contact a Web Socket server when the Web
   Socket protocol is used from a Web page.  Naturally, when the Web
   Socket protocol is used directly (not from a Web page), the origin
   model is not useful, as the client can provide any arbitrary origin
   string.

   This protocol is intended to fail to establish a connection with
   servers of pre-existing protocols like SMTP or HTTP, while allowing
   HTTP servers to opt-in to supporting this protocol if desired.  This
   is achieved by having a strict and elaborate handshake, and by
   limiting the data that can be inserted into the connection before the
   handshake is finished (thus limiting how much the server can be
   influenced).

1.5.  Relationship to TCP/IP and HTTP

   _This section is non-normative._

   The Web Socket protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol.  Its
   only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by
   HTTP servers as an Upgrade request.

   Based on the expert recommendation of the IANA, the Web Socket
   protocol by default uses port 80 for regular Web Socket connections
   and port 443 for Web Socket connections tunneled over TLS.

Internet-Draft           The Web Socket protocol           December 2009


1.6.  Establishing a connection

   _This section is non-normative._

   There are several options for establishing a Web Socket connection.

   On the face of it, the simplest method would seem to be to use port
   80 to get a direct connection to a Web Socket server.  Port 80
   traffic, however, will often be intercepted by HTTP proxies, which
   can lead to the connection failing to be established.

   The most reliable method, therefore, is to use TLS encryption and
   port 443 to connect directly to a Web Socket server.  This has the
   advantage of being more secure; however, TLS encryption can be
   computationally expensive.

   When a connection is to be made to a port that is shared by an HTTP
   server (a situation that is quite likely to occur with traffic to
   ports 80 and 443), the connection will appear to the HTTP server to
   be a regular GET request with an Upgrade offer.  In relatively simple
   setups with just one IP address and a single server for all traffic
   to a single hostname, this might allow a practical way for systems
   based on the Web Socket protocol to be deployed.  In more elaborate
   setups (e.g. with load balancers and multiple servers), a dedicated
   set of hosts for Web Socket connections separate from the HTTP
   servers is probably easier to manage.

1.7.  Writing a simple Web Socket server

   _This section is non-normative._

   If the Web Socket protocol is being used to provide a feature for a
   specific site, then the handshake can be hard-coded, and the data
   provided by the client in the handshake can be safely ignored.  This
   section describes an implementation strategy for this case.

   Listen on a port for TCP/IP.  Upon receiving a connection request,
   open a connection and send the following bytes back to the client:

        48 54 54 50 2F 31 2E 31  20 31 30 31 20 57 65 62
        20 53 6F 63 6B 65 74 20  50 72 6F 74 6F 63 6F 6C
        20 48 61 6E 64 73 68 61  6B 65 0D 0A 55 70 67 72
        61 64 65 3A 20 57 65 62  53 6F 63 6B 65 74 0D 0A
        43 6F 6E 6E 65 63 74 69  6F 6E 3A 20 55 70 67 72
        61 64 65 0D 0A 57 65 62  53 6F 63 6B 65 74 2D 4F
        72 69 67 69 6E 3A 20

   Send the ASCII serialization of the origin from which the server is

   willing to accept connections.  [ORIGIN]

      For example: |http://example.com|

   Continue by sending the following bytes back to the client:

        0D 0A 57 65 62 53 6F 63  6B 65 74 2D 4C 6F 63 61
        74 69 6F 6E 3A 20

   Send the URL of the Web Socket script.

      For example: |ws://example.com/demo|

   Finish the handshake by sending the four bytes 0x0D 0x0A 0x0D 0x0A to
   the client.  Then, read data _from_ the client until four bytes 0x0D
   0x0A 0x0D 0x0A are read.

   NOTE: User agents will drop the connection after the handshake if the
   origin and URL sent as part of the algorithm above don't match what
   the client sent to the server, to protect the server from third-party
   scripts.  This is why the server has to send these strings: to
   confirm which origins and URLs the server is willing to service.

   At this point, there are two concerns: receiving frames and sending
   frames.

   To receive a frame, read a byte, verify that it is a 0x00 byte, then
   read bytes until you find a 0xFF byte, and interpret all the bytes
   between the 0x00 and 0xFF bytes as a UTF-8 string (the frame payload,
   or message).  This process can be repeated as necessary.  If at any
   point the first byte of one of these sequences is not 0x00, then an
   error has occurred, and closing the connection is the appropriate
   response.

   To send a frame, first send a 0x00 byte, then send the message as a
   UTF-8 string, then send a 0xFF byte.  Again, this process can be
   repeated as necessary.

   The connection can be closed as desired.

1.8.  Subprotocols using the Web Socket protocol

   _This section is non-normative._

   The client can request that the server use a specific subprotocol by
   including the |Websocket-Protocol| header in its handshake.  If it is
   specified, the server needs to include the same header and value in
   its response for the connection to be established.

Internet-Draft           The Web Socket protocol           December 2009


   These subprotocol names do not need to be registered, but if a
   subprotocol is intended to be implemented by multiple independent Web
   Socket servers, potential clashes with the names of subprotocols
   defined independently can be avoided by using names that contain the
   domain name of the subprotocol's originator.  For example, if Example
   Corporation were to create a Chat subprotocol to be implemented by
   many servers around the Web, they could name it "chat.example.com".
   If the Example Organisation called their competing subprotocol
   "example.org's chat protocol", then the two subprotocols could be
   implemented by servers simultaneously, with the server dynamically
   selecting which subprotocol to use based on the value sent by the
   client.

   Subprotocols can be versioned in backwards-incompatible ways by
   changing the subprotocol name, eg. going from "bookings.example.net"
   to "bookings.example.net2".  These subprotocols would be considered
   completely separate by Web Socket clients.  Backwards-compatible
   versioning can be implemented by reusing the same subprotocol string
   but carefully designing the actual subprotocol to support this kind
   of extensibility.

2.  Conformance requirements

   All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-
   normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
   Everything else in this specification is normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.  For
   readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in
   this specification.  [RFC2119]

   Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
   "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
   steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
   ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.

   Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may
   be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
   equivalent.  (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
   specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to
   be performant.)

   Implementations may impose implementation-specific limits on
   otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of service
   attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around
   platform-specific limitations.

   The conformance classes defined by this specification are user agents
   and servers.

2.1.  Terminology

   *Converting a string to ASCII lowercase* means replacing all

3.  Web Socket URLs

3.1.  Parsing Web Socket URLs

   The steps to *parse a Web Socket URL's components* from a string
   /url/ are as follows.  These steps return either a /host/, a /port/,
   a /resource name/, and a /secure/ flag, or they fail.

   1.   If the /url/ string is not an absolute URL, then fail this
        algorithm.  [WEBADDRESSES]

   2.   Resolve the /url/ string using the resolve a Web address
        algorithm defined by the Web addresses specification, with the
        URL character encoding set to UTF-8.  [WEBADDRESSES] [RFC3629]

        NOTE: It doesn't matter what it is resolved relative to, since
        we already know it is an absolute URL at this point.

   3.   If /url/ does not have a <scheme> component whose value, when
        converted to ASCII lowercase, is either "ws" or "wss", then fail
        this algorithm.

   4.   If /url/ has a <fragment> component, then fail this algorithm.

   5.   If the <scheme> component of /url/ is "ws", set /secure/ to
        false; otherwise, the <scheme> component is "wss", set /secure/
        to true.

   6.   Let /host/ be the value of the <host> component of /url/,
        converted to ASCII lowercase.

   7.   If /url/ has a <port> component, then let /port/ be that
        component's value; otherwise, there is no explicit /port/.

   8.   If there is no explicit /port/, then: if /secure/ is false, let
        /port/ be 80, otherwise let /port/ be 443.

   9.   Let /resource name/ be the value of the <path> component (which
        might be empty) of /url/.

   10.  If /resource name/ is the empty string, set it to a single
        character U+002F SOLIDUS (/).

   11.  If /url/ has a <query> component, then append a single U+003F
        QUESTION MARK character (?) to /resource name/, followed by the
        value of the <query> component.

   12.  Return /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure/.

3.2.  Constructing Web Socket URLs

   The steps to *construct a Web Socket URL* from a /host/, a /port/, a
   /resource name/, and a /secure/ flag, are as follows:

   1.  Let /url/ be the empty string.

   2.  If the /secure/ flag is false, then append the string "ws://" to
       /url/.  Otherwise, append the string "wss://" to /url/.

   3.  Append /host/ to /url/.

   4.  If the /secure/ flag is false and port is not 80, or if the
       /secure/ flag is true and port is not 443, then append the string
       ":" followed by /port/ to /url/.

   5.  Append /resource name/ to /url/.

   6.  Return /url/.

4.  Client-side requirements

   _This section only applies to user agents, not to servers._

   NOTE: This specification doesn't currently define a limit to the
   number of simultaneous connections that a client can establish to a
   server.

4.1.  Handshake

   When the user agent is to *establish a Web Socket connection* to a
   host /host/, on a port /port/, from an origin whose ASCII
   serialization is /origin/, with a flag /secure/, with a string giving
   a /resource name/, and optionally with a string giving a /protocol/,
   it must run the following steps.  The /host/ must be ASCII-only (i.e.
   it must have been punycode-encoded already if necessary).  The
   /resource name/ and /protocol/ strings must be non-empty strings of
   ASCII characters in the range U+0020 to U+007E. The /resource name/
   string must start with a U+002F SOLIDUS character (/) and must not
   contain a U+0020 SPACE character.  [ORIGIN]

   1.   If the user agent already has a Web Socket connection to the
        remote host (IP address) identified by /host/, even if known by
        another name, wait until that connection has been established or
        for that connection to have failed.

        NOTE: This makes it harder for a script to perform a denial of
        service attack by just opening a large number of Web Socket
        connections to a remote host.

        NOTE: There is no limit to the number of established Web Socket
        connections a user agent can have with a single remote host.
        Servers can refuse to connect users with an excessive number of
        connections, or disconnect resource-hogging users when suffering
        high load.

   2.   _Connect_: If the user agent is configured to use a proxy when
        using the Web Socket protocol to connect to host /host/ and/or
        port /port/, then connect to that proxy and ask it to open a
        TCP/IP connection to the host given by /host/ and the port given
        by /port/.

           EXAMPLE: For example, if the user agent uses an HTTP proxy
           for all traffic, then if it was to try to connect to port 80
           on server example.com, it might send the following lines to
           the proxy server:

              CONNECT example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
              Host: example.com

           If there was a password, the connection might look like:

              CONNECT example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
              Host: example.com
              Proxy-authorization: Basic ZWRuYW1vZGU6bm9jYXBlcyE=

        Otherwise, if the user agent is not configured to use a proxy,
        then open a TCP/IP connection to the host given by /host/ and
        the port given by /port/.

        NOTE: Implementations that do not expose explicit UI for
        selecting a proxy for Web Socket connections separate from other
        proxies are encouraged to use a SOCKS proxy for Web Socket
        connections, if available, or failing that, to prefer the proxy
        configured for HTTPS connections over the proxy configured for
        HTTP connections.

        For the purpose of proxy autoconfiguration scripts, the URL to
        pass the function must be constructed from /host/, /port/,
        /resource name/, and the /secure/ flag using the steps to
        construct a Web Socket URL.

        NOTE: The Web Socket protocol can be identified in proxy
        autoconfiguration scripts from the scheme ("ws:" for unencrypted
        connections and "wss:" for encrypted connections).

   3.   If the connection could not be opened, then fail the Web Socket
        connection and abort these steps.

   4.   If /secure/ is true, perform a TLS handshake over the
        connection.  If this fails (e.g. the server's certificate could
        not be verified), then fail the Web Socket connection and abort
        these steps.  Otherwise, all further communication on this
        channel must run through the encrypted tunnel.  [RFC2246]

        User agents must use the Server Name Indication extension in the
        TLS handshake.  [RFC4366]

   5.   Send the following bytes to the remote side (the server):

           47 45 54 20

        Send the /resource name/ value, encoded as ASCII.

        Send the following bytes:

        Send the following bytes:

           0d 0a

        NOTE: The string "WebSocket-Protocol: ", the protocol, and CRLF.

   9.   If the client has any cookies that would be relevant to a
        resource accessed over HTTP, if /secure/ is false, or HTTPS, if
        it is true, on host /host/, port /port/, with /resource name/ as
        the path (and possibly query parameters), then HTTP headers that
        would be appropriate for that information should be sent at this
        point.  [RFC2616] [RFC2109] [RFC2965]

        Each header must be on a line of its own (each ending with a
        CRLF sequence).  For the purposes of this step, each header must
        not be split into multiple lines (despite HTTP otherwise
        allowing this with continuation lines).

   10.  Send the following bytes:

           0d 0a

        NOTE: Just a CRLF (a blank line).

   11.  Read bytes from the server until either the connection closes,
        or a 0x0A byte is read.  Let /header/ be these bytes, including
        the 0x0A byte.

        If /header/ is not at least two bytes long, or if the last two
        bytes aren't 0x0D and 0x0A respectively, then fail the Web
        Socket connection and abort these steps.

        User agents may apply a timeout to this step, failing the Web
        Socket connection if the server does not send back data in a
        suitable time period.

   12.  If /header/ consists of 44 bytes that exactly match the
        following, then let /mode/ be _normal_.

        NOTE: The string "HTTP/1.1 101 Web Socket Protocol Handshake"
        followed by a CRLF pair.

        NOTE: Note that this means that if a server responds with a Web
        Socket handshake but with the string "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.2" at
        the front, a normal Web Socket connection will not be
        established.

        Otherwise, let /code/ be the substring of /header/ that starts
        from the byte after the first 0x20 byte, and ends with the byte
        before the second 0x20 byte.  If there are not at least two 0x20
        bytes in /header/, then fail the Web Socket connection and abort
        these steps.

        If /code/, interpreted as ASCII, is "407", then either close the
        connection and jump back to step 2, providing appropriate
        authentication information, or fail the Web Socket connection.
        407 is the code used by HTTP meaning "Proxy Authentication
        Required".  User agents that support proxy authentication must
        interpret the response as defined by HTTP (e.g. to find and
        interpret the |Proxy-Authenticate| header).

        Otherwise, fail the Web Socket connection and abort these steps.

   13.  If /mode/ is _normal_, then read 41 bytes from the server.

        If the connection closes before 41 bytes are received, or if the
        41 bytes aren't exactly equal to the following bytes, then fail
        the Web Socket connection and abort these steps.

        bytes within a suitable time period.

   2.  Handle the /frame type/ byte as follows:

       If the high-order bit of the /frame type/ byte is set (i.e. if
       /frame type/ _and_ed with 0x80 returns 0x80)
          Run these steps.  If at any point during these steps a read is
          attempted but fails because the Web Socket connection is
          closed, then abort.

          1.  Let /length/ be zero.

          2.  _Length_: Read a byte, let /b/ be that byte.

          3.  Let /b_v/ be integer corresponding to the low 7 bits of
              /b/ (the value you would get by _and_ing /b/ with 0x7F).

          4.  Multiply /length/ by 128, add /b_v/ to that result, and
              store the final result in /length/.

          5.  If the high-order bit of /b/ is set (i.e. if /b/ _and_ed
              with 0x80 returns 0x80), then return to the step above
              labeled _length_.

          6.  Read /length/ bytes.

          7.  Discard the read bytes.

       If the high-order bit of the /frame type/ byte is _not_ set (i.e.
       if /frame type/ _and_ed with 0x80 returns 0x00)
          Run these steps.  If at any point during these steps a read is
          attempted but fails because the Web Socket connection is
          closed, then abort.

          1.  Let /raw data/ be an empty byte array.

          2.  _Data_: Read a byte, let /b/ be that byte.  If the client
              runs out of resources for buffering the incoming data, or
              hits an artificial resource limit intended to avoid
              resource starvation, then it must fail the Web Socket
              connection and abort these steps.

          3.  If /b/ is not 0xFF, then append /b/ to /raw data/ and
              return to the previous step (labeled _data_).

          4.  Interpret /raw data/ as a UTF-8 string, and store that
              string in /data/.

          5.  If /frame type/ is 0x00, then *a message has been
              received* with text /data/.  Otherwise, discard the data.

   3.  Return to the first step to read the next byte.

   If the user agent is faced with content that is too large to be
   handled appropriately, then it must fail the Web Socket connection.


   Once a Web Socket connection is established, the user agent must use
   the following steps to *send /data/ using the Web Socket*:

   1.  Send a 0x00 byte to the server.

   2.  Encode /data/ using UTF-8 and send the resulting byte stream to
       the server.

   3.  Send a 0xFF byte to the server.

   If at any point there is a fatal problem with sending data to the
   server, the user agent must fail the Web Socket connection.

4.3.  Closing the connection

   To *fail the Web Socket connection*, the user agent must close the
   Web Socket connection, and may report the problem to the user (which
   would be especially useful for developers).  However, user agents
   must not convey the failure information to the script that attempted
   the connection in a way distinguishable from the Web Socket being
   closed normally.

   Except as indicated above or as specified by the application layer
   (e.g. a script using the Web Socket API), user agents should not
   close the connection.

4.4.  Handling errors in UTF-8

   When a client is to interpret a byte stream as UTF-8 but finds that
   the byte stream is not in fact a valid UTF-8 stream, then any bytes
   or sequences of bytes that are not valid UTF-8 sequences must be
   interpreted as a U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.

5.  Server-side requirements

   _This section only applies to servers._

5.1.  Sending the server's handshake

   When a client establishes a Web Socket connection to a server, the
   server must either close the connection or send the server handshake.
   Servers may read part or all of the client's handshake (as described
   in the next section) before closing the connection or sending all of
   their side of the handshake; indeed, in some cases this is necessary
   as the server might need to use some of the information in the
   client's handshake to construct it's own handshake.

   If the server supports encryption, then the server must perform a TLS
   handshake over the connection before sending the server handshake.
   If this fails (e.g. the client indicated a host name in the extended
   client hello "server_name" extension that the server does not host),
   then the server must close the connection; otherwise, all further
   communication for the connection (including the server handshake)
   must run through the encrypted tunnel.  [RFC2246]

   To send the server handshake, the server must first establish the
   following information:

   /origin/
      The ASCII serialization of the origin that the server is willing
      to communicate with.  If the server can respond to requests from
      multiple origins (or indeed, all origins), then the value should
      be derived from the client's handshake, specifically from the
      "Origin" field.  [ORIGIN]

   /host/
      The host name or IP address of the Web Socket server, as it is to
      be addressed by clients.  The host name must be punycode-encoded
      if necessary.  If the server can respond to requests to multiple
      hosts (e.g. in a virtual hosting environment), then the value
      should be derived from the client's handshake, specifically from
      the "Host" field.

   /port/
      The port number on which the server expected and/or received the
      connection.

   /resource name/
      An identifier for the service provided by the server.  If the
      server provides multiple services, then the value should be
      derived from the client's handshake, specifically from the "Host"

      field.


      True if the connection is encrypted or if the server expected it
      to be encrypted; false otherwise.

   /subprotocol/
      Either null, or a string representing the subprotocol the server
      is ready to use.  If the server supports multiple subprotocols,
      then the value should be derived from the client's handshake,
      specifically from the "WebSocket-Protocol" field.  The absence of
      such a field is equivalent to the null value.  The empty string is
      not the same as the null value for these purposes.

   Having established this information, the server must start the
   handshake.  The initial part of the server's handshake is invariant,
   and must consist of the following bytes:

        48 54 54 50 2F 31 2E 31  20 31 30 31 20 57 65 62
        20 53 6F 63 6B 65 74 20  50 72 6F 74 6F 63 6F 6C
        20 48 61 6E 64 73 68 61  6B 65 0D 0A 55 70 67 72
        61 64 65 3A 20 57 65 62  53 6F 63 6B 65 74 0D 0A
        43 6F 6E 6E 65 63 74 69  6F 6E 3A 20 55 70 67 72
        61 64 65 0D 0A 57 65 62  53 6F 63 6B 65 74 2D 4F
        72 69 67 69 6E 3A 20

   These bytes must be the first bytes sent on the TCP connection by the
   server.  They must be followed by the /origin/ string, encoded as
   ASCII, followed by the following bytes:

        0D 0A 57 65 62 53 6F 63  6B 65 74 2D 4C 6F 63 61
        74 69 6F 6E 3A 20

   The server must then send the string that results from constructing a
   Web Socket URL from /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure
   flag/, encoded as ASCII.

   If the /subprotocol/ is not null, then the server must then send the
   following bytes:

        0D 0A 57 65 62 53 6F 63  6B 65 74 2D 50 72 6F 74
        6F 63 6F 6C 3A 20

   ...followed by the /subprotocol/ string, encoded as ASCII.

   Finally, the server must end its side of the handshake by sending the
   four bytes 0x0D 0x0A 0x0D 0x0A to the client.

5.2.  Reading the client's handshake

   When a client starts a Web Socket connection, it sends its part of
   the handshake.  This consists of a number of fields separated by CRLF
   pairs (bytes 0x0D 0x0A).

   The first field consists of three tokens separated by space
   characters (byte 0x20).  The first token is the string "GET", the
   middle token is the resource name, and the third is the string
   "HTTP/1.1".

   If the first field does not have three tokens, or if the first and
   third tokens aren't the strings given in the previous paragraph, or
   if the second token doesn't begin with U+002F SOLIDUS character (/),
   the server should abort the connection: it either represents an
   errorneous Web Socket client or a connection from a client expecting
   another protocol altogether.

   The subsequent fields consist of a string representing a name, a
   colon and a space (bytes 0x3A 0x20), and a string representing a
   value.  The possible names, and the meaning of their corresponding
   values, are as follows:

   Upgrade (bytes 55 70 67 72 61 64 65; always the first name-value
   pair)
      Invariant part of the handshake.  Will always have a value
      consisting of bytes 57 65 62 53 6F 63 6B 65 74.

   Connection (bytes 43 6F 6E 6E 65 63 74 69 6F 6E; always the second
   name-value pair)
      Invariant part of the handshake.  Will always have a value
      consisting of bytes 55 70 67 72 61 64 65.

   Host (bytes 48 6F 73 74; always the third name-value pair)
      The value gives the hostname that the client intended to use when
      opening the Web Socket.  It would be of interest in particular to
      virtual hosting environments, where one server might serve
      multiple hosts, and might therefore want to return different data.
      The value must be interpreted as UTF-8.

   Origin (bytes 4F 72 69 67 69 6E; always the fourth name-value pair)
      The value gives the scheme, hostname, and port (if it's not the
      default port for the given scheme) of the page that asked the
      client to open the Web Socket.  It would be interesting if the
      server's operator had deals with operators of other sites, since
      the server could then decide how to respond (or indeed, _whether_
      to respond) based on which site was requesting a connection.  The
      value must be interpreted as UTF-8.

   WebSocket-Protocol (bytes 57 65 62 53 6F 63 6B 65 74 2D 50 72 6F 74
   6F 63 6F 6C; optional, if present, will be the fifth name-value
   pair)
      The value gives the name of a subprotocol that the client is
      intending to select.  It would be interesting if the server
      supports multiple protocols or protocol versions.  The value must
      be interpreted as UTF-8.

   Other fields
      Other fields can be used, such as "Cookie", for authentication
      purposes.  Their semantics are equivalent to the semantics of the
      HTTP headers with the same names.

   A final field consisting of the empty string (two consecutive CRLF
   pairs) indicates the end of the client's handshake.

   Any fields that lack the colon-space separator must at a minimum be
   discarded and may cause the server to disconnect.

   Whether the server does or does not read the client handshake, it
   must at a minimum read (and optionally discard) bytes until it has
   read the first sequence of four bytes 0x0A 0x0D 0x0A 0x0D, which
   signals the end of the client handshake.  Servers may do this before
   or after sending their handshake, but must do it before reading
   frames from the client as described in the next section.

5.3.  Data framing

   The server must run through the following steps to process the bytes
   sent by the client:

   1.  _Frame_: Read a byte from the client.  Let /type/ be that byte.

   2.  If /type/ is not a 0x00 byte, then the server may disconnect from
       the client.

   3.  If the most significant bit of /type/ is not set, then run the
       following steps:

       1.  Let /raw data/ be an empty byte array.

       2.  _Data_: Read a byte, let /b/ be that byte.

       3.  If /b/ is not 0xFF, then append /b/ to /raw data/ and return
           to the previous step (labeled _data_).

       4.  Interpret /raw data/ as a UTF-8 string, and apply whatever
           server-specific processing is to occur for the resulting

           string (the message from the client).

       Otherwise, the most significant bit of /type/ is set.  Run the
       following steps.  This can never happen if /type/ is 0x00, and
       therefore these steps are not necessary if the server aborts when
       /type/ is not 0x00, as allowed above.

       5.   Let /length/ be zero.

       6.   _Length_: Read a byte, let /b/ be that byte.

       7.   Let /b_v/ be integer corresponding to the low 7 bits of /b/
            (the value you would get by _and_ing /b/ with 0x7F).

       8.   Multiply /length/ by 128, add /b_v/ to that result, and
            store the final result in /length/.

       9.   If the high-order bit of /b/ is set (i.e. if /b/ _and_ed
            with 0x80 returns 0x80), then return to the step above
            labeled _length_.

       10.  Read /length/ bytes.

       11.  Discard the read bytes.

   4.  Return to the step labeled _frame_.


   The server must run through the following steps to send strings to
   the client:

   1.  Send a 0x00 byte to the client to indicate the start of a string.

   2.  Encode /data/ using UTF-8 and send the resulting byte stream to
       the client.

   3.  Send a 0xFF byte to the client to indicate the end of the
       message.

5.4.  Handling errors in UTF-8

   When a server is to interpret a byte stream as UTF-8 but finds that
   the byte stream is not in fact a valid UTF-8 stream, behaviour is
   undefined.  A server could close the connection, convert invalid byte
   sequences to U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs, store the data verbatim,
   or perform application-specific processing.  Subprotocols layered on
   the Web Socket protocol might define specific behavior for servers.

6.  Closing the connection

   To *close the Web Socket connection*, either the user agent or the
   server closes the TCP/IP connection.  There is no closing handshake.
   When a user agent notices that the server has closed its connection,
   it must immediately close its side of the connection also.  Whether
   the user agent or the server closes the connection first, it is said
   that the *Web Socket connection is closed*.

   Servers may close the Web Socket connection whenever desired.  User
   agents should not close the Web Socket connection arbitrarily.

7.  Security considerations

   While this protocol is intended to be used by scripts in Web pages,
   it can also be used directly by hosts.  Such hosts are acting on
   their own behalf, and can therefore send fake "Origin" headers,
   misleading the server.  Servers should therefore be careful about
   assuming that they are talking directly to scripts from known
   origins, and must consider that they might be accessed in unexpected
   ways.  In particular, a server should not trust that any input is
   valid.

   EXAMPLE: For example, if the server uses input as part of SQL
   queries, all input text should be escaped before being passed to the
   SQL server, lest the server be susceptible to SQL injection.


   Servers that are not intended to process input from any Web page but
   only for certain sites should verify the "Origin" header is an origin
   they expect, and should only respond with the corresponding
   "WebSocket-Origin" if it is an accepted origin.  Servers that only
   accept input from one origin can just send back that value in the
   "WebSocket-Origin" header, without bothering to check the client's
   value.


   If at any time a server is faced with data that it does not
   understand, or that violates some criteria by which the server
   determines safety of input, or when the server sees a handshake that
   does not correspond to the values the server is expecting (e.g.
   incorrect path or origin), the server should just disconnect.  It is
   always safe to disconnect.


   The biggest security risk when sending text data using this protocol
   is sending data using the wrong encoding.  If an attacker can trick
   the server into sending data encoded as ISO-8859-1 verbatim (for
   instance), rather than encoded as UTF-8, then the attacker could
   inject arbitrary frames into the data stream.

   The |WebSocket-Origin| header is used in the Web Socket handshake.
   It is sent from the server to the client to confirm the origin of the
   script that opened the connection.  This enables user agents to
   verify that the server is willing to serve the script that opened the
   connection.

   The |WebSocket-Protocol| header is used in the Web Socket handshake.
   It is sent from the client to the server and back from the server to
   the client to confirm the subprotocol of the connection.  This
   enables scripts to both select a subprotocol and be sure that the
   server agreed to serve that subprotocol.

   The |WebSocket-Location| header is used in the Web Socket handshake.
   It is sent from the server to the client to confirm the URL of the
   connection.  This enables the client to verify that the connection
   was established to the right server, port, and path, instead of
   relying on the server to verify that the requested host, port, and
   path are correct.

9.  Using the Web Socket protocol from other specifications

   The Web Socket protocol is intended to be used by another
   specification to provide a generic mechanism for dynamic author-
   defined content, e.g. in a specification defining a scripted API.

   Such a specification first needs to "establish a Web Socket
   connection", providing that algorithm with:

   o  The destination, consisting of a /host/ and a /port/.

   o  A /resource name/, which allows for multiple services to be
      identified at one host and port.

   o  A /secure/ flag, which is true if the connection is to be
      encrypted, and false otherwise.

   o  An ASCII serialization of an origin that is being made responsible
      for the connection.  [ORIGIN]

   o  Optionally a string identifying a protocol that is to be layered
      over the Web Socket connection.

   The /host/, /port/, /resource name/, and /secure/ flag are usually
   obtained from a URL using the steps to parse a Web Socket URL's
   components.  These steps fail if the URL does not specify a Web
   Socket.

   If a connection can be established, then it is said that the "Web
   Socket connection is established".

   If at any time the connection is to be closed, then the specification
   needs to use the "close the Web Socket connection" algorithm.

   When the connection is closed, for any reason including failure to
   establish the connection in the first place, it is said that the "Web
   Socket connection is closed".

   While a connection is open, the specification will need to handle the
   cases when "a Web Socket message has been received" with text /data/.

   To send some text /data/ to an open connection, the specification
   needs to "send /data/ using the Web Socket".
