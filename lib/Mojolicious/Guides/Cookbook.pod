Mojolicious::Guides::Cookbook - Cookbook

=head1 OVERVIEW

Cooking with L<Mojolicious>, recipes for every taste.

=head1 DEPLOYMENT

Getting L<Mojolicious> and L<Mojolicious::Lite> applications running on
different platforms.

=head2 Rewriting

Sometimes you might have to deploy your application in a broken blackbox
environment where you can't just fix the server configuration.
In such cases you can use a C<before_dispatch> hook to rewrite incoming
requests.

    app->hook(before_dispatch => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        my $secure = $self->req->headers->header('X-Is-Secure');
        $self->req->url->base->scheme('https') if $secure;
    });

=head2 Builtin Server

L<Mojolicious> contains a very portable HTTP 1.1 compliant web server.
It is usally used during development but is solid and fast enough for small
to mid sized applications.

    % ./script/myapp daemon
    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

It has many configuration options and is known to work on every platform
Perl works on.

    % ./script/myapp help daemon
    ...List of available options...

Another huge advantage is that it supports TLS and WebSockets out of the box.

    % ./script/myapp daemon --listen https://*:3000
    Server available at https://*:3000.

A development certificate for testing purposes is built right in, so it just
works.

=head2 Hypnotoad

For bigger applications L<Mojolicious> contains the UNIX optimized preforking
web server L<Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad> that will allow you to take advantage
of multiple cpu cores and copy-on-write.

    Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad
    |- Mojo::Server::Daemon [1]
    |- Mojo::Server::Daemon [2]
    |- Mojo::Server::Daemon [3]
    `- Mojo::Server::Daemon [4]

It is based on the normal builtin web server but optimized specifically for
production environments out of the box.

    % hypnotoad script/myapp
    Server available at http://*:8080.

Config files are plain Perl scripts for maximal customizability.

    # hypnotoad.conf
    {listen => ['http://*:80'], workers => 10};

But one of its biggest advantages is the support for effortless zero downtime
software upgrades.
That means you can upgrade L<Mojolicious>, Perl or even system libraries at
runtime without ever stopping the server or losing a single incoming
connection, just by sending it a C<USR2> signal.

    % kill -s 'USR2' `cat hypnotoad.pid`

=head2 Nginx

One of the most popular setups these days is the builtin web server behind a
Nginx reverse proxy.

    upstream myapp {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;
        location / {
            proxy_read_timeout 300;
            proxy_pass http://myapp;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }

You might also want to enable reverse proxy support in C<hypnotoad> if your
proxy is on a different physical machine than your application and can't be
auto detected.

    # hypnotoad.conf
    {proxy => 1};

=head2 Apache/CGI

C<CGI> is supported out of the box and your L<Mojolicious> application will
automatically detect that it is executed as a C<CGI> script.

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName localhost
        DocumentRoot /home/sri/myapp/public

        ScriptAlias /myapp "/home/sri/myapp/script/myapp"
    </VirtualHost>

=head2 Apache/FastCGI

C<FastCGI> is also supported out of the box and your L<Mojolicious>
application will automatically detect that it is executed as a C<FastCGI>
script.

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName localhost
        DocumentRoot /home/sri/myapp/public

        FastCgiServer /home/sri/myapp/script/myapp -processes 10
        Alias /myapp /home/sri/myapp/script/myapp
    </VirtualHost>

=head2 PSGI/Plack

L<PSGI> is an interface between Perl web frameworks and web servers, and
L<Plack> is a Perl module and toolkit that contains PSGI middleware, helpers
and adapters to web servers.
L<PSGI> and L<Plack> are inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack.
L<Mojolicious> applications are ridiculously simple to deploy with L<Plack>.

    % plackup ./script/myapp
    HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/

L<Plack> provides many server and protocol adapters for you to choose from
such as C<FCGI>, C<SCGI> and C<mod_perl>.
Make sure to run C<plackup> from your applications home directory, otherwise
libraries might not be found.

    % plackup ./script/myapp -s FCGI -l /tmp/myapp.sock

Because C<plackup> uses a weird trick to load your script, L<Mojolicious> is
not always able to detect the applications home directory, if thats the case
you can simply use the C<MOJO_HOME> environment variable.
Also note that C<app-E<gt>start> needs to be the last Perl statement in the
application script for the same reason.

    % MOJO_HOME=/home/sri/myapp plackup ./script/myapp
    HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/

Some server adapters might ask for a C<.psgi> file, if thats the case you can
just point them at your application script because it will automatically
act like one if it detects the presence of a C<PLACK_ENV> environment
variable.

=head2 Apache/mod_perl (PSGI/Plack)

C<mod_perl> is a good example for a L<PSGI> adapter that is used without
C<plackup>, note that setting the C<PLACK_ENV> environment variable is
required for L<Mojolicious> L<PSGI> detection.

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName localhost
        DocumentRoot /home/sri/myapp/public

        <Perl>
            $ENV{PLACK_ENV} = 'production';
            $ENV{MOJO_HOME} = '/home/sri/myapp';
        </Perl>

        <Location /myapp>
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlHandler Plack::Handler::Apache2
            PerlSetVar psgi_app /home/sri/myapp/script/myapp
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

=head2 IIS6.0/FastCGI

We don't suggest using IIS, it is a horribly broken web server, avoid it if
you can.
There is nothing we can do to make this a pleasant experience for you, but
maybe we can at least ease some of the pain.

First you should make sure to get recent versions of C<Strawberry Perl> and
L<Mojolicious> installed, C<Strawberry> is as good as a Windows version of
Perl can be.

Then you'll have to install IIS 6.0 and its FastCGI extension, which is not
part of the standard installation.
Create a new website with C<Control Panel> > C<Administrative Tools> >
C<Internet Information Services Manager> > C<Action> > C<New> > C<Web Site>
and finish the installation wizard.

Open your newly created websites properties and select the tab C<Web Site>.
Set the proper values for C<Site Description>, C<IP Address>, C<TCP Port>,
C<SSL Port> etc.

On the tab C<Home Directory> set C<Local Path> to C<c:\myapp\public>,
C<Local Path Permission Flags> to C<Read> and C<Log Visits>,
C<Execute Permissions> to C<Scripts Only>.

Click on the C<Configuration> button and then C<Insert>
(next to C<Wildcard Application Mappings>).
In the next dialog set C<Executable> to
C<c:\windows\system32\inetsrv\fcgiext.dll> and uncheck
C<Verify That Files Exist>.

Now put the following lines into C<c:\windows\system32\inetsrv\fcgiext.ini>
or C<c:\windows\syswow64\inetsrv\fcgiext.ini> on 64-bit systems.

    [Types]
    *=MyApp

    [MyApp]
    ExePath=c:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe
    Arguments="c:\myapp\script\myapp fastcgi"

    ; Let IIS serve static files
    IgnoreExistingFiles=0
    IgnoreDirectories=1

There is one more thing, IIS sometimes clears your environment variables but
Windows won't work without C<SYSTEMROOT>, so you might have to set it
manually in your application.

    # Application
    package MyApp;
    use base 'Mojolicious';

    sub startup {
        my $self = shift;

        # Use event hook to set environment variable for every request
        $self->hook(
            before_dispatch => sub { $ENV{SYSTEMROOT} = 'c:\\winnt' }
        );
    }

    1;

=head1 FUN

Hacks that might not be very useful but are fun! :)

=head2 Hello World

If every byte matters this is the smallest C<Hello World> application you can
write with L<Mojolicious::Lite>.

    use Mojolicious::Lite;
    get '/' => {text => 'Hello World!'};
    app->start;

It works because automatic rendering kicks in even if no actual code gets
executed by the router, the renderer just picks up the C<text> value from the
stash and generates a response.
