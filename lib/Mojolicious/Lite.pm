=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Lite - Micro real-time web framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Automatically enables "strict", "warnings", "utf8" and Perl 5.16 features
  use Mojolicious::Lite -signatures;

  # Route with placeholder
  get '/:foo' => sub ($c) {
    my $foo = $c->param('foo');
    $c->render(text => "Hello from $foo.");
  };

  # Start the Mojolicious command system
  app->start;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Lite> is a tiny domain specific language built around L<Mojolicious>, made up of only about a dozen Perl
functions.

On Perl 5.20+ you can also use a C<-signatures> flag to enable support for L<subroutine
signatures|perlsub/"Signatures">.

  use Mojolicious::Lite -signatures;

  get '/:foo' => sub ($c) {
    my $foo = $c->param('foo');
    $c->render(text => "Hello from $foo.");
  };

  app->start;

See L<Mojolicious::Guides::Tutorial> for more!

=head1 GROWING

While L<Mojolicious::Guides::Growing> will give you a detailed introduction to growing a L<Mojolicious::Lite> prototype
into a well-structured L<Mojolicious> application, here we have collected a few snippets that illustrate very well just
how similar both of them are.

=head2 Routes

The functions L</"get">, L</"post"> and friends all have equivalent methods.

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  get '/foo' => sub ($c) {
    $c->render(text => 'Hello World!');
  };

  # Mojolicious
  sub startup ($self) {
  
    my $routes = $self->routes;
    $routes->get('/foo' => sub ($c) {
      $c->render(text => 'Hello World!');
    });
  }

=head2 Application

The application object you can access with the function L</"app"> is the first argument passed to the C<startup>
method.

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  app->max_request_size(16777216);

  # Mojolicious
  sub startup ($self) {
    $self->max_request_size(16777216);
  }

=head2 Plugins

Instead of the L</"plugin"> function you just use the method L<Mojolicious/"plugin">.

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  plugin 'Config';

  # Mojolicious
  sub startup ($self) {
    $self->plugin('Config');
  }

=head2 Helpers

Similar to plugins, instead of the L</"helper"> function you just use the method L<Mojolicious/"helper">.

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  helper two => sub ($c) {
    return 1 + 1;
  };

  # Mojolicious
  sub startup ($self) {
    $self->helper(two => sub ($c) {
      return 1 + 1;
    });
  }

=head2 Under

Instead of sequential function calls, we can use methods to build a tree with nested routes, that much better
illustrates how routes work internally.

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  under '/foo';
  get '/bar' => sub ($c) {...};

  # Mojolicious
  sub startup ($self) {

    my $routes = $self->routes;
    my $foo = $routes->under('/foo');
    $foo->get('/bar' => sub ($c) {...});
  }

=head1 FUNCTIONS

L<Mojolicious::Lite> implements the following functions, which are automatically exported.

=head2 any

  my $route = any '/:foo' => sub ($c) {...};
  my $route = any '/:foo' => sub ($c) {...} => 'name';
  my $route = any '/:foo' => {foo => 'bar'} => sub ($c) {...};
  my $route = any '/:foo' => [foo => qr/\w+/] => sub ($c) {...};
  my $route = any ['GET', 'POST'] => '/:foo' => sub ($c) {...};
